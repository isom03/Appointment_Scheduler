Directions:
* Launch Application
* Login into the application with correct user information (Users testing the application can use the "test" as the username 
  and password to log in)
* Once you log in you will be brought to a table view of all the customers listed in the database
* From here you can update a specific customer's info, add new customers, delete customers, go to view all
  appointments, or view three reports that were built into the application.
* While viewing the appointments table you can update a specific appointment, add new appointments, delete
appointments, or return to the table view of all customers.
* If you choose to review the reports page you can generate three different reports: one report tallies the total number
  of appointments given an appointment month and type, a second lets you look at a table view of scheduled appointments.
  for a selected contact, the last allows you to look at a selected customer's total number of appointments.
