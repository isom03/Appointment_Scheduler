Directions:
* Launch Application
* Login into application with correct user information
* Once you log in you will be brought to a table view of all the customers listed in the database
* From here you can update a specific customer's info, add new customers, delete customers, go to view of all
appointments, or view three reports that were built into the application
* While viewing the appointments table you can update a specific appointment, add new appointments, delete
appointments, or return back to the table view of all customers
* If you choose to review the reports page you can generate three different reports: one report tallies the total number
of appointments given an appointment month and type, a second lets you look at a table view of scheduled appointments
for a selected contact, the last allows you to look at a selected customers total number of appointments

Additional Report (part 3.A.f): For my additional report I wanted a quick and simple way to see how many appointments
a customer currently had scheduled. My report asks the user to select a customer's name from a combo-box then
displays the total number of appointments the user has
